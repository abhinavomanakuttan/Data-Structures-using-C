        Algorithum

Step1: Start
Step2: Read the limit 'n'
Step3: Read the n Number into an array
Step4: Read the Searchkey
Step5: Reapet the following steps until i<n
    Step5.1:Check if(arr[i]==key) -> if true go to step 5.1.1
      Step5.1.1:print the element is present in the list at index i
      Step5.1.2:Break the loop
Step6:Print the element is not present in the list
